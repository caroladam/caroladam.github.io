I'm a zoologist broadly interested in using genetic and genomic data to better understand the evolutionary history of model and non-model organisms and in studying the microevolutionary processes controlling their population dynamics and genetic diversity. 

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Rohlfs Lab](https://rohlfslab.weebly.com/) at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution - University of Oregon, investigating the underlying mechanisms dictating Tandem Repeat evolution and their adaptive potential in ape genomes.
