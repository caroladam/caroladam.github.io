  Tandem repeats (TRs) are repetitive DNA sequences crucial in genome evolution and function.
  Technological limitations held back our grasp of these elements until recently. Now, with long-read, high-fidelity whole-genome sequencing and advanced analytical tools, we are poised to uncover the extensive TR variation across eukaryotic genomes.
  During my postdoc research, I am focused on understanding the evolution of TRs in primate genomesâ€”particularly humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos.
  We are leveraging long-read data within and between species to test evolutionary hypotheses about how TR variation drives ape adaptation.
